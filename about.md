Hi,
My name is Johannes Barstad. I have a master of science in finance, and work with data. I find the increased use of data fascinating, and do my best to learn as much as possible about the subject.

I have made this blog to have somewhere to write down and explain interesting topics, mostly for my own benefit to solidify learning, but also for others if they are interested in reading it. My goal is to explain things in a way that makes them easy to understand, as topics in this domain usually look more complicated than they are, and are often taught in a way that makes people lose interest. 

Topics that probably will be most prominent:
- Variuos types of data analytics
- Machine learning / deep learning
- Finance related topics
- Python
